			</header>
            <p>I used to be a graphic/web designer and got to design a lot of pretty things for some very cool clients. These days, I prefer slinging code to designing branding. I've hung up my Pantone deck and am now a Business Information Technology student (starting term 3) at Red River College.</p>
