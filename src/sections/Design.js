            <p>I was a graphic-slash-web-designer for 11 years. Some of the projects I worked on:</p>
            <ul>
    	        <li><span role="img" aria-label="soup">&#x1F372;</span> Designed two soup <a href="https://crafted.wag.ca/cookbook" target="_blank">cookbooks</a>, <i>Down to Earth</i>, for the Winnipeg Art Gallery (<b>bonus</b>: I got to taste a lot of soup and the project has raised $30,000 for Winnipeg Harvest). You can still buy copies from my old company, <a href="https://www.ayokodesign.com/shop/" target="_blank">Ayoko Design</a>.</li>
    	        <li><span role="img" aria-label="laptop">&#x1F4BB;</span> 30+ Websites for restaurants, tradeshows, production companies, accountants and a ton of other small to medium-sized businesses.</li>
    	        <li><span role="img" aria-label="magazine">&#x1F4D3;</span> 20+ magazines ranging from trade publications to wedding magazines.</li>
                <li><span role="img" aria-label="newspaper">&#x1F4F0;</span> Designed <a href="https://www.uniter.ca" target="_blank">The Uniter's</a> website (sadly changed since then) and weekly print newspaper from 2010-2014.</li>
        	</ul>
            <h4>Clients</h4>
            <p>I designed/coded the front-end of the websites for the following clients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wonderful Wedding Show | <a href="https://wonderfulweddingshow.com/" target="_blank" title="The Wonderful Wedding Show">Website</a></li>
                <li>Perths | <a href="http://perths.ca/" target="_blank" title="Perth's Drycleaners">Website</a></li>
            </ul>
